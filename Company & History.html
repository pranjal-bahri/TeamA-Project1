   <h3> <i>Our History </i> </h3>
     <h1>Party On a Plate was founded in 2012 by Abby Ledger, who created her company with one idea in mind: the best parties deserve food that everyone actually wants to eat. Abby noticed that many events she attended offered complicated food options that a typical party attendee may not enjoy. Given her passion for food, Abby saw a great opportunity to put her culinary skills acquired from 15 years of professional food service experience to use in an untapped local market. She set out to create a catering company built on crowd-pleasing classics, but maintaining the quality and flavor she had a knack for bringing to the table.
      She started small, keeping it manageable with events like family dinners, small community get togethers, and her son Ryan’s grade school parties. Ledger served all the classics: mac n’ cheese, chicken tenders, assorted salads, dessert platters, and soft drinks. Word spread fast through town, and soon Party on a Plate was known as the place to call when you wanted good food, good service, and happy guests.
      Now Party on a Plate has grown into a local staple here in Lafayette, and Ledger only sees it growing from there. Over the years, the team has grown, but our philosophy has stayed the same: keep it simple, keep it delicious, and keep the party going. Whether it’s a birthday, tailgate, office lunch, or community celebration, we bring comfort food favorites that never fail to make people smile. </h1>
